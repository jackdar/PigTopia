# An Evolutionary Pig Simulator 🐖

Get ready to pig out on the most insane 2d pig simulator coming your way – Pigtopia: An evolutionary pig simulator. Inspired by the classic 2D games of the past, and with mechanics from games such as Spore, with a piggy twist!

Developed to be cross platform on Android, iOS, macOS, and PC. Written in C# using the Unity game engine.

## Key Features 🐽

### Evolutionary Gameplay 🧬
Starting out as a humble piglet, munch on some sensational chicken and you’ll grow, evolve and level up! Guide your piggy through various stages of life, adapt and evolve based on your eating habits and decisions, shaping your pig’s chunkiness and abilities.

### Feasting on Sensational Chicken 🐔
The path to evolution begins with Sensational Chicken. Gorge yourself on a large chicken meat on chips and watch as your pig grows in size and ability. Each meat on chips devoured brings you closer to your next evolution!

### Unlock Unique Pig Abilities and Looks 🎩
As you progress through the evolutionary stages, unlock a wide range of quirky pig abilities. Shoot lasers from your snout, harness the power of super speed, and so much more. Also, your pig can be customized to stand out from the crowd and share your pigs look with your friends!

### Cosmic Proportions 🪐
As your pig evolves, aspire to reach cosmic proportions! Grow larger and more impressive with each evolution until your pig’s size becomes unfathomable. The sense of accomplishment and spectacle when becoming the cosmic pig will leave your friends in awe!

### Do It Your Way, And with Friends! 🧑‍🤝‍🧑
Your pig’s destiny is in your hands! Make choices and adapt your piggy style accordingly. While we are taking a single player first approach to the game, we are wanting to implement a friend system where you can compare your pigs’ stats, abilities, and style with your friends. A multiplayer system where you can come across other pigs and your friends in game will also be a high priority feature!
